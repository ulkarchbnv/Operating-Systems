# Easter Bunny King Competition 

## üê∞ Task
Spring is here, and the bunnies are getting ready for the "Easter Bunny King" election. 
The "Chief Bunny" will organise a competition between the bunny boys to see who can recite the most beautiful watering poem
and collect the most red eggs for it from the bunny girls.

For example: "Red eggs, white bunny, a kiss for watering!"

The bunnies must register for the competition - when you register, you must give the bunny's name (e.g. Bunny LongEar) 
and the poem you want to recite. There should be a counter as well, the number of collected eggs (at the time of entry is 0). 
The one who collects the most red eggs from the bunny girls during the watering will be the Easter Bunny King.

The data of the registered applicants have to be stored in a file. 
In addition to the registering (data entry), we should have the possibility to modify, 
delete and create a complete list of applicants.

Create a C language program to solve this task, the solution should run either on opsys.inf.elte.hu or on a Linux system similar to it. The solution must be presented to the tutor during the week following the deadline.
